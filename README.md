**Empowering parents to discover their child's hidden talents byond grades.**

## 📖 Overview
**Early Spark** is an AI-powered platform designed to identify children's unique strengths beyond traditional academic grades. Leveraging **Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences**, the system analyzes behavioral video inputs to provide parents with a comprehensive dashboard, highlighting whether their child is Kinesthetic, Spatial, Logical, etc., along with personalized activity recommendations.
